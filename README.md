## üîç Analysis Components

### Keyword Matching (Default: 50% weight)
- **Automatic Extraction**: Identifies technical skills, tools, experience levels
- **Intelligent Weighting**: 
  - Technical skills (Python, React, AWS): Weight 8-9
  - Experience patterns (5+ years, senior): Weight 6-7
  - Education terms: Weight 4-5
  - Soft skills: Weight 3
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Handles variations and abbreviations
- **Frequency Analysis**: High-priority keywords need multiple mentions

### Semantic Similarity (Default: 30% weight)
- Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity
- Captures overall job-resume alignment beyond specific keywords
- Considers context and related terms

### Education Matching (Default: 20% weight)
- Extracts degree requirements from job descriptions
- Matches against resume education information
- Supports various degree formats and abbreviations

## üéØ Scoring Logic

### Keyword Frequency Requirements
- **High-Priority Keywords (Weight ‚â•6)**:
  - 4+ mentions: 100% credit
  - 3 mentions: 75% credit
  - 2 mentions: 50% credit
  - 1 mention: 25% credit
- **Regular Keywords**: Single mention gives full credit

### Match Quality Thresholds
- **Exact Match**: 100% score
- **High Quality (‚â•90%)**: Full weight
- **Good Quality (‚â•70%)**: 95% weight
- **Acceptable (‚â•60%)**: 90% weight
- **Below 60%**: Not counted

## üìà Understanding Results

### Score Breakdown
- **Individual Scores**: Each component (keywords, similarity, education) scored 0-100%
- **Weighted Overall Score**: Combined score based on your weight configuration
- **Status**: Selected/Rejected based on cutoff threshold

### Detailed Analysis
- **Keywords Found**: Shows matched terms with confidence scores and frequency
- **Keywords Missing**: Important terms not found in the resume
- **Education Analysis**: Comparison of job requirements vs. resume education
- **Frequency Multipliers**: Shows how frequency affects high-priority keyword scoring

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization Options

### Manual Keywords
- Add specific requirements not captured by automatic extraction
- Set custom weights (1-10) based on importance
- Boost critical skills for your specific role

### Scoring Weights
- Adjust component weights based on role requirements:
  - **Technical roles**: Increase keyword weight
  - **Senior positions**: Balance all components
  - **Entry-level**: Increase education weight

### Selection Cutoff
- **Conservative (80-90%)**: For highly competitive positions
- **Balanced (70-80%)**: For most standard roles
- **Liberal (60-70%)**: For hard-to-fill positions

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. File Upload Errors**
- Ensure files are in PDF or Word format
- Check that files aren't password-protected or corrupted
- Try converting files to a different format if issues persist

**2. Poor Keyword Extraction**

- Review the keyword preview to ensure relevant terms are captured
- Check frequency requirements for high-priority keywords

**4. Performance Issues**
- Large PDF files may take longer to process
- Consider processing resumes in smaller batches
- Ensure adequate system memory for large files
